## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was created as part of a Udacity course. 
In this project I am interested in AirBnb listings in Berlin. Mainly descriptive analysis is shown here. 

Among other things, the following questions are addressed: 

1. What's the vibe like in the different neighborhoods in Berlin? 
2. How does the neighborhood influence the price of the listings? Is there a correlation between price and location rating? Are there any anomalies here?
3. Are there fluctuations in the price over time? When is it more expensive, when is it cheaper? Do we see a similar pattern for all neighborhoods?
4. Is there a correlation between the Super Host rate and the price? Where are the most Super Hosts? Does the Super Host rate have an influence on the review scores? 
5. Can the price of the listings be predicted from other characteristics of the listings? Does the neighborhood have an influence here?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@franziska.taruttis/aebde94af87).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like! In particular, the code should be transferable to other cities on this site with minor changes.
